Data::Iterator::EasyObj - Turn an array of arrays into an iterator object
=========================================================================

Data::Iterator::EasyObj makes your array of arrays into a handy iterator object with the ability to further nest additional data structures including Data::Iterator::EasyObj objects.

The iterator object provides direct access to the iterator contents - as well as the ability to add or update fields as you use the object.

The iterator object can also be limited or offset on the fly ideal for paging or grouping data sets.
